**CERTIFICATE VALIDATION USING BLOCKCHAIN**
* Abstract: In this project to secure academic certificate and for accurate management and to avoid
forge certificate we are converting all certificates into digital signatures and this digital
signatures will be stored in Blockchain server as this Blockchain server support tamper proof
data storage and nobody can hack or alter its data and if by an chance if its data alter then
verification get failed at next block storage and user may get intimation about data alter.
In Blockchain technology same transaction data stored at multiple server with hash code
verification and if data alter at one server then it will detected from other server as for same data
hash code will get different. For example in Blockchain technology data will be stored at
multiple servers and if malicious users alter data at one server then its hash code will get changed
in one server and other servers left unchanged and this changed hash code will be detected at
verification time and future malicious user changes can be prevented.
In Blockchain each data will be stored by verifying old hash codes and if old hash codes
remain unchanged then data will be consider as original and unchanged and then new transaction
data will be appended to Blockchain as new block. For each new data storage all blocks hash
code will be verified.
